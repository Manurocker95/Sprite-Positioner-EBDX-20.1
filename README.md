# Sprite-Positioner-EBDX-20.1


A simple to use applet to help you easily position your battler sprites. Does not need to be installed in a specific location or your RMXP project. Once you run the app, you will be prompted to select the location of the Game.rxproj of the project for which you want to position sprites. Use the arrow keys, mouse and scrollwheel to navigate the system.

This is an adapted version of the original resource for v19.1: https://luka-sj.com/res/POSX but ported to 20.1.
